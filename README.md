Download or copy the script - Load-ADModule.ps1 to the victim and run in a PowerShell session. Should give you access to the Active Directory PowerShell cmdlets.
There is also the raw DLL, which many say can be just Imported into the session via Import-Module, but in my experience this has never worked, hence the script.
